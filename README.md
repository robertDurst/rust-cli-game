# High Low -- My First Rust CLI Game
I began learning the rust programming language about two weeks ago. It was finally time to build something, so I came up with a classic CLI game, *High Low*. The rules are simple: guess whether or not the next number is greater than the previous number.

## Quick Start
```
# download CLI Game
git clone https://github.com/robertDurst/rust-cli-game.git
cd game

# build
cargo build

# run
./target/debug/game
```
