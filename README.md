# High Low -- My First Rust CLI Game
I began learning the rust programming language about two weeks ago. It was finally time to build something, so I came up with a classic CLI game, *High Low*. The rules are simple: guess whether or not the next number is greater than the previous number.

## Quick Start
```
# download CLI Game
git clone https://github.com/robertDurst/rust-cli-game.git
cd game

# build
cargo build

# run
./target/debug/game
```

## New concepts I have used in this repo:
- [x] Struct
- [x] Method
- [x] Function
- [x] Private function
- [x] Module
- [x] Private Module
- [x] Lib + exec/bin combo
- [x] External crate
- [x] Use keyword
- [x] Mod keyword
- [x] Loop
- [ ] While
- [ ] For
- [ ] Borrow (ownership)
- [ ] Move (ownership)
- [ ] Include dependencies
- [ ] Match
- [ ] If Let
- [ ] Enums
- [ ] Comments
- [ ] Comments -- docs
